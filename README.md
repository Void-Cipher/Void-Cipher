# ‚úçÔ∏è Dev Quote
### In a world built on code, the unseen becomes power.
### I am the shadow in the system, the cipher in the void. I don't just see the matrix, I bend it. Vulnerabilities are my roadmap, exploits are my weapon, and knowledge is my only ally. The art of hacking is not destruction‚Äîit's creation, innovation, and evolution.
### I don't follow the code; I rewrite it. I don't break systems; I uncover their truth.
### Every lock has a key. Every firewall has a weakness. And every system is just waiting to be understood.
### Welcome to my world. This is the digital frontier.
